The handkerchief breaks and the wall falls\ndown.\n\nWe reach the base of the rock and start to climb.  One by one we\nsee, from different angles, the handkerchief has separated. \n\nWe climb, and the water keeps pouring down, the water covering\nthe walls. We climb again, and the water keeps pouring\ndown. It starts getting light and the handkerchief\nis separating again. We are climbing at\nhalf-speed and the water has begun to get dark.\n\nFinally, we reach the top of the wall, where a water-tight, \ncold room looks through a door on the wall.

Behind\n          it, a framed PHOTO of an OLD YOUNG MAN with two arms\n          pinned across his chest -- a man in a bad way.  A man with\n          cancer.  And a YOUNG WOMAN standing inside.\n          He stops short.  This is an open wound that goes deep\n          in his chest.

Just a faint\n          lightening effect, as though it were a flickering candle in\n          darkness.  An empty pauper's room on the edge of town.  On\n          the other side of it, a little child watches from a\n          little crib on the porch.  He's still crying.

Takes\n          one last, hard look back.  And the window behind him\n          FLICKES... LIGHTNINGNING.  He turns, peeks inside.

They rush out.\n\n\tThe elevator is now sealed, and with it the escape.  In the darkness, \n\tthe sounds of the soldiers are more distinct.  The lights of the \n\tfire escape are off.  Now the smoke starts to move across the \n\tfire escape.  The floorboards are starting to move, and the Soldiers \n\tare starting to realize that the elevators are not just a \n\tstretch.  They are a tunnel, and only the narrow entrance is an \n\tairlock.  A moment later...\n\n\tThe Soldiers run through the doorway.

Suddenly \n\tshe looks down at the ceiling, and then back at her.  She takes a \n\tstep toward the light switch in her lap, but \n\tshe has forgotten her clothes.  She gets into the elevator.\n\n\tShe comes out the door.  She looks down at the floor, and \n\tshe sees a door with red light flashing through it.  The \n\twoman stops, surprised.

CARPETED HOUSE - DAY\n\nA CARPETED HOUSE lies in the driveway.  From behind us, the\nscene of the murder becomes visible.  It is a cold, barren field. \n\nThe CARPETED HOUSE, covered with tarpaulins and blanket, is dark; it is\nempty except for an unfinished brick and a lone wooden tree.  A few\npeople are standing on the porch.  The sound of the distant\nsiren grows louder.  They turn off the road and push past the\ncarpet, moving up the driveway until they enter the house. \n\nThe sound is still louder.  Mick and the others take the same\npath to the carpeted house.  There are no windows, only\na white cot.  We can see the house from the front and in\nfront of it, the sun streams over a single log wall.  At the\nfront wall are the remains of a couple's wedding present.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\tMICK\n\t\tWhere is the rest?\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDEPUTY MCCLANE\n\t\tIt's all right. \n\nA LITTLE BOY stands up.  He can see the scene.  The scene\nis empty, and the little boy is standing alone.  He stares\ntowards the house, but we don't hear him.  He reaches for a\npot in the corner.  He looks into the pot, but it's full of\ntears and blood.  He picks them up, wipes his hands with\nthe lid, and throws them away.  He doesn't look at\nthe little boy.  He stands there, stares straight ahead.  Then he\nputs his coat and hat back on.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMICK\n\t\tMaybe it's the dog.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDEPUTY MCCLANE\n\t\tMaybe it is, Mick. \n\nHe pulls off his hat.  There are tears in his eyes.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMICK\n\t\tLet's keep moving.\n\nAs Mick and the others start forward, the noise is\nhard to distinguish from the silence in the yard. \n\nA large animal is crouched by a tree, its hind paws clawed\ninto the bark.  The little boy's mother is kneeling on\nthe ground.  The girl stands close, her hand out\nof reach of the boy. \n\n\n\t\t\tMICK\n\t\tThere.  There.  The dog's back.\n\nThe boy is still staring ahead.  As he does, we\nsee the wolf's head is pointing out of the\nhouse.\n\n\n\t\t\tMICK\n\t\tThe house is haunted. \n\nSuddenly, the girl looks up at the house, her hand is\nstill gripped in her lap.  It is the dog.\nIt turns the corner and we see the house is\ncaved in behind it. \n\nCUT TO PAST.  We see the house in the background as\nit is torn apart.  The boy runs into a yard, the\nwoman, scared, follows. \n\n\n\t\t\tMICK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhere is that dog?\n\nA shot on the window as the little boy reaches out, reaching\nfor the woman, but she is already outside the door.
